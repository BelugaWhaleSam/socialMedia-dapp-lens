Social media web dapp, we can get recommended profiles and posts using lens protocol that provides decentralised social graph for our profile.

Tech stack used are urql and graphql to create client establish connection to Api and query.
urql uses lens protocol's deployed contract address and api endpoint. Also used lens api
such as queryRecommendProfiles and queryExplorePublications to get posts and profiles.

For front end I have used react js, for styling chakra UI.
